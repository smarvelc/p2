Project 2:
Live URL: http://p2.smarvelc.me
This project uses some php arrays, loops, and user input to create a password 
based off of an xkcd comic. The user can put in the number of words he/she 
wants and it will create a password of that length. He/She can also specify if
they would like a symbol or number added on as well. 

I will be doing a Jing Screencast demo, but I am currently in a rush to get 
this online and do not have it set up yet. The link will be added by Tuesday 
when it is due.

Here is the link to the Jing Screencast: http://screencast.com/t/6BpQcsTfV
